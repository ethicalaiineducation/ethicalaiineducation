        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly progressing in its capabilities to take on intellectual challenges that once were considered solely in the domain of human intelligence. We see our ability to think as a central element to our humanity. Education is where we refine and grow the next generation’s ability to think and reason. This is why addressing the role of AI in education is of critical importance.</p>
        
        <p>While we now think little of hopping in a car that lets us move faster than any human, or using a computer to retrieve information that would be impossible for a human to recall directly, the advent of Large Language Models and their human-like reasoning capabilities has sparked fear and concern.</p>
        
        <p>While this technology seems to threaten human intellectual flourishing, we believe that, properly harnessed, advanced AI can be a great accelerator for human thinking and intellectual capabilities. The key to this happening, however, is defining the right role for this technology and designing systems that align to this vision.</p>
        
        <p>The future we want to avoid is one we are already naturally stepping into: one where a Large Language Model offers to analyze a book and write a paper all by itself, robbing students of the educational journey and accompanying intellectual growth that comes from doing these activities themselves. This is a future where each generation becomes less intellectually curious and capable, relying instead on AI to do the important work of reasoning and thinking.</p>
        
        <p>We have lived in a world where no human alone could beat Deep Blue at chess (1997) and one where no human could beat an AI at Jeopardy (2012). People still play chess and Jeopardy is still on the air. However, the current top chess grandmasters and Jeopardy contestants didn’t get there by having these AI systems do the work for them. Similarly, we should design educational systems that support students as they do the work of developing their minds.</p>

        <h2>The Principles</h2>
        <ol class="principles">
            <li><strong>AI as a Learning Assistant, Not a Replacement</strong><br>
                AI should support learning by providing guidance, insights, and scaffolding—not replace a student’s intellectual effort. AI tools should enhance understanding, curiosity, and problem-solving, not serve as an outsourcing tool for work.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Promoting Critical Thinking Over Automation</strong><br>
                Educational AI should be designed and used in ways that promote deep learning, analytical reasoning, and original thought rather than simply automating tasks or generating answers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Transparency in AI Usage</strong><br>
                Students, educators, and stakeholders should be aware when AI is being used and understand how it influences learning outcomes. Clear policies should prevent misuse while allowing students to see AI as a tool rather than a shortcut.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Preserving Academic Integrity</strong><br>
                AI should not be used in ways that encourage plagiarism, academic dishonesty, or passive learning. Institutions should develop guidelines that maintain the value of authentic learning experiences.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Leveling the Playing Field</strong><br>
                AI should be used to bring better teaching and tailored educational coaching to students of all backgrounds, resources, and preparation, closing the gap of equal access to high quality instruction, promoting equality of opportunity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Protecting Student Data & Privacy</strong><br>
                Educational AI must adhere to strict data privacy and security policies, ensuring that student information is not misused, sold, or exploited for profit.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Keeping the Human Element in Education</strong><br>
                AI should enhance the educator’s role, not replace it. Teachers should use AI as a teaching aid to foster meaningful interactions, mentorship, and personalized feedback.</li>
        </ol>
